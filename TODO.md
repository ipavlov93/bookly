## TODO list

1. Add cache to store token after it's been verified and minimize amount of future requests.
2. Add store and reset OAuth cookies (on login and logout).
3. How to set or create user with roles or privileges in OIDC (OAuth) flow ?
- Sign in flow first. Set roles and privileges (permissions)
- ??? Create user by email with given roles and privileges. Send email with confirmation link (with expiration time).
